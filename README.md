# TvA_curves_analysis_data

This repo contains the data and analysis scripts for the paper entitled "Error accumulation when steering toward curves"

To run the analysis, clone this repo into your work directory. Check your working directory in R by running getwd() in the command line. 

The Curves_Analysis_Preprocessing.Rmd file generates the overall.dat.csv file and isn't needed for the modelling but can be run if trial level metrics need to be recalculated.

Manuscript plots and modelling analysis can be done by running each chunk of the Curves_Analysis_Modelling_And_Plots.Rmd.
